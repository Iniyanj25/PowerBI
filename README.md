This project analyzes sales data with Power BI and AI-driven visuals to uncover trends, seasonality, and performance patterns.
It uses line charts and monthly breakdowns to highlight key sales fluctuations.January 2023 is identified as the peak period, while February 2023 is the lowest. 
The analysis also reveals long-term growth phases and sharp declines. Forecasting techniques predict future sales, allowing comparisons between actual values and expected trends. 
This helps in understanding overall business performance. 

The project also uses AI visuals and smart narratives to spot anomalies and explain their possible causes, like promotions, sudden changes in demand, or reporting issues.
These insights help assess the reliability of the forecast model and provide practical guidance for management. 
This includes preparing for high-demand periods, addressing sudden drops, and focusing on AI forecasts mainly for short-term planning. 
Overall, the project shows how AI-powered analytics can improve decision-making and optimize sales strategies.
